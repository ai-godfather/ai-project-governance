## What Is This System?

The AI Workflow System is an **enterprise-grade, multi-agent execution framework** designed for:

- ✅ Large codebase management (500M+ records scale)
- ✅ Multi-agent parallel work with zero context leakage
- ✅ Deterministic, repeatable validation processes
- ✅ Semantic integrity enforcement
- ✅ Runtime verification certainty
- ✅ Production-grade auditability

## Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Code is Truth** | Code > Snapshot > Docs > Plans |
| **No Guessing** | Agents verify, never assume |
| **Scope Lock** | Each role has strict boundaries |
| **Failure Pattern Awareness** | 89 documented FPs inform all decisions |
| **Runtime Verification** | Browser execution proves UI correctness |

## Supreme Law

`.cursorrules` is the **SUPREME LAW** of this system.

All agents MUST follow `.cursorrules` without exception. Violations are treated as BLOCKER-level failures.
